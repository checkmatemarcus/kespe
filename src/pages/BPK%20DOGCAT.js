            <h1>We all have that friend who fucks up the game for everyone else.</h1>

            <p> You've arrived at the right place to get some tips on how you can motivate your friend.

                Inting (intentional feeding)
                in League of Legends is a serious problem that can negatively impact the gameplay experience for both the player inting and their teammates.
                Here are some tips to help your friend calm down and perform better in the top lane:

                Encourage him to take a break: If your friend is consistently inting, it's possible that he's just having a bad day, drunk or feeling burnt out from playing too much.
                Suggest that he take a break from the game for a few hours or even a day or two to refresh his mind and come back with a clearer head.

                he might have enjoyed too many beers and topless sisters.

                Provide constructive criticism: When your friend does make a mistake, try to give him constructive feedback on what he could have done differently.
                Don't focus on the negative or blame him for the loss, but rather offer suggestions for improvement.

                Help him identify his strengths and weaknesses: Ask your friend what champions and playstyles he feels most comfortable with.
                If he's struggling in top lane, it might be worth exploring other roles or champions that better suit his playstyle.
                Additionally, help him identify areas where he can improve, such as last-hitting minions or better map awareness.

                Remind him to stay positive: Negative attitudes can be contagious, and a defeatist mindset can quickly spread throughout the team.
                Encourage your friend to stay positive and focus on what he can do to turn the game around, rather than dwelling on mistakes or losses.

                Play together: Playing with friends can be a great way to alleviate stress and improve communication.
                Queue up with your friend and offer him support during the game. This can also help him feel more comfortable in the top lane, knowing that he has a friend to rely on.

                Remember, everyone has bad games, and it's important to support your friend rather than criticizing him. Offer constructive feedback and encouragement,
                and remind him that the goal is to have fun and improve, not necessarily to win every game.</p>
